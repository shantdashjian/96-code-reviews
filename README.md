# 96-code-reviews

## Description:
This is a list of 96 recorded code reviews I delivered for students in the Frontend Career path between May and July of 2023 over the period of 3 months. As a result of delivering those code reviews, the Scrimba team awarded me the "Code Reviewer of the Week" award in May of 2023 and also offered me the opportunity to join the Scrimba Team as a Mentor/TA.
