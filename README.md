# 96-code-reviews

This is [a playlist of 96 recorded code reviews](https://scrimba.com/playlist/p5gJNNMtd) I delivered for [Scrimba Bootcamp students](https://scrimba.com/) over the period of 3 months, between May and July of 2023. As a result of delivering those code reviews, the [Scrimba Bootcamp Team](https://scrimba.com/about) awarded me the *Code Reviewer of the Week* award in May of 2023. They also offered me the opportunity to join the Scrimba Team as a Mentor/TA, which I accepted.
